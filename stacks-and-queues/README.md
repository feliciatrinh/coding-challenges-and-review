* [Animal Shelter](animal_shelter.py)
	* Represent an animal shelter using queue data structure.
* [Balanced](balanced.java)
	* Returns true if a string consisting of '{', '}', '[', ']' is balanced. "{[{}]}" is balanced.
	* Uses a stack. Runtime: O(n)
    * See [Valid Parenthese](valid_parentheses.py) for a similar problem in Python.
* [Client Messages](client_messages.py)
    * Given a list of Message objects containing a type and an owner, return one possible assignment of client-IDs to
    B-type messages which will make the sequence valid.
    * Runtime: O(N), Space: O(N)
* [Min Stack](min_stack.py)
	* Implement a stack class that enables requests for the minimum value in the stack.
	* Uses a doubly linked list.
* [Queue Via Stacks](queue_via_stacks.py)
	* Implement a queue using two stacks.
* [Reverse Queue](reverseQueue.java)
	* Reverse a stack using a queue.
	* Runtime: O(n)
* [Sorted Stack](sorted_stack.py)
	* Sort a stack such that the smallest items are on top using an additional temporary stack.
