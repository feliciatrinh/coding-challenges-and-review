# Linked Lists
* [Add Two Numbers](add_two_numbers.py)
	* Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-neg ints, add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
	* Runtime: O(n) for single pass through each list
* [Binary](binary.py)
	* Given a linked list representation of a binary number, return the decimal representation.
	* Runtime: O(n)
* [Delete Greater](delete_greater.py)
	* Given the head of a linked list and an integer x, delete all nodes from the linked list with values greater than x.
	* Runtime: O(n)
* [Detect Cycle](detect_cycle.py)
	* Given a linked list, return True if there's a cycle and False otherwise.
	* Runtime: O(n), Space complexity: O(1) using two pointer method
* [Nth Node](Nth_node.py)
	* Given the head of a linked list, return the head of the linked list after removing the n-th node.
	* Runtime: O(n)
* [Palindrome Linked List](palindrome_linked_list.py)
	* Given a singly linked list, return True if linked list is a palindrome and False otherwise.
	* Runtime: O(n)
	* TODO: write a solution that uses O(1) additional space
* [Partition](partition.py)
	* Partition a linked list around a value x such that all nodes with values less than x come before all nodes with
	values greater than or equal to x.
	* Runtime: O(n)
* [Remove Duplicates](remove_dups.py)
	* Remove duplicates from a singly linked list. 
	* Runtime: O(n)
* [Reverse](reverse_linked_list.py)
	* Reverse a singly linked list iteratively or recursively.
	* Runtime: O(n)
* [Swap Pairs](swap_pairs.py)
	* Swap nodes pairwise in a singly linked list.
	* Runtime: O(n)
