"""
Print all possible paths from the top left to the bottom right of an m x n matrix.

Input: m x n matrix
Output: Paths as lists

Solution: use recursion to determine all possible paths when you can only move down and to the right.
Runtime: exponential

Example: 
[[1, 2, 3], 
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]

Has paths
[1, 4, 7, 8, 9]
[1, 4, 5, 8, 9]
[1, 4, 5, 6, 9]
[1, 2, 5, 8, 9]
[1, 2, 5, 6, 9]
[1, 2, 3, 6, 9]
