"""
Input: 2D array of 1's and 0's
Output: list of all starting and ending points of rectangles filled with 0's

Rectangle can be a single 0.
Assume rectangles cannot touch each other. 

Example output: [[(2, 3), (3, 5)], [(3, 6), (5, 6)]]

    As we iterate through the matrix, once we find a starting 0
    we look to the right and down for the ending 0.
    Replace these 0's by 1 so that we don't double count
    these as rectangles as we traverse through the rest of the matrix.
    Can optimize by making the outer loop the smaller dimension.
