"""
Input: n: number of nodes in the circular array; endNodes: list of ending nodes representing the paths taken.
Output: the node that is visited the most. If there are multiple, return the smallest numbered node.

Circular array has n nodes numbered from 1 to n.
Assume endNode[i] != endNode[i + 1]

Example:
Input: 3, [1, 3, 2, 3]
Output: 2

Paths taken: 1, 2, 3
			 3, 1, 2
			 2, 3

Nodes 2 and 3 are visited 3 times, so the lower numbered node is returned.

Input: 10, [1, 5, 10, 5]
Output: 5 (5 is visited 3 times)
