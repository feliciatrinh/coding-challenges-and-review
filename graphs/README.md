# Graphs

* [Breadth First Search](breadth_first_paths.py)
	* Use breadth first search graph traversal algorithm to print the breadth first path.
	* Uses adjacency list implementation for graph G.
	* Uses a queue to keep track of vertices.
	* Runtime O(V + E), Space O(V)
* [Depth First Search](depth_first_search.py)
	* Find a path from start to every other reachable vertex, visiting each vertex only once.
	* Uses adjacency list implementation for graph G.
	* Uses a stack.
	* Runtime O(V + E), Space O(V)
* [Matrix Paths](matrix_paths.py)
	* Print all possible paths from the top left to the bottom right of an m x n matrix.
	* Runtime: exponential?
* [Route Between Nodes](routeBetweenNodes.py)
	* Adapted iterative BFS to find if there is a route between two nodes.
	* Runtime O(V + E), Space O(V)
