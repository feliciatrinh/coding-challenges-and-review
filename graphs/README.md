# Graphs

* [A\*](a_star.py)
	* 
* [Breadth First Search](breadth_first_search.py)
	* Use breadth first search graph traversal algorithm to print the breadth first path.
	* Uses adjacency list implementation for graph G.
	* Uses a queue to keep track of vertices.
	* Can use breadth first search to find the shortest path, whether there is a path between two vertices, etc.
	* Runtime: O(V + E), Space complexity: O(V)
* [Depth First Search](depth_first_search.py)
	* Find a path from start to every other reachable vertex, visiting each vertex only once.
	* Uses adjacency list implementation for graph G.
	* Uses a stack.
	* Runtime: O(V + E), Space complexity: O(V)
* [Dijkstra's Algorithm](dijkstra.py)
	* 
* [Matrix Paths](matrix_paths.py)
	* Print all possible paths from the top left to the bottom right of an m x n matrix.
	* Runtime: exponential?
