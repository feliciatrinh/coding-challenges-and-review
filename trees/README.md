# Trees

* [Binary Search Tree](binary_search_tree.py)
	* search()
	* insert()
	* delete()
	* minVal()
	* isBST()
* [Binary Tree to Binary Search Tree](binary_tree_to_bst.py)
	* Given a binary tree, return it as a binary search tree without changing the spatial structure.
	* Runtime: O(nlogn)
* [List of Depths](list_of_depths.py)
	* Given a binary tree, return a linked list of all nodes at each depth.
* [Minimal Tree](minimal_tree.py)
	* Given a sorted increasing order array with unique integer elements, create a BST with minimal height.
	* Runtime: O(n)? recursive solution
* [Tree Traversal](tree_traversal.py)
	* Pre-order
	* In-order
	* Post-order
	* Level-order
	* Zig-Zag Level-order: alternate left to right 
* [Valid Binary Tree](validBinaryTree.java)
	* Given a binary tree as a sequence of parent-child pairs, output the highest priority error if an error is present.
	* Used hashmap and hashsets for O(1) time adds and accesses
