# Linked Lists
* [Add Two Numbers](addTwoNumbers.py)
	* Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-neg ints, add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
	* Runtime: $O(n)$ for single pass through each list
* [Binary](binary.py)
	* Given a linked list representation of a binary number, return the decimal representation.
	* Runtime: $O(n)$
* [Delete Greater](deleteGreater.py)
	* Given the head of a linked list and an integer x, delete all nodes from the linked list with values greater than x.
	* Runtime: $O(n)$
* [Delete Middle Node](deleteMiddleNode.py)
	* Given a node, delete this node from the middle of its linked list. Assumes there is a non-null node after the input node.
* [Kth Node](kth_node.py)
	* Given the head of a linked list, return the kth to last node of the linked list.
	* Two pointer method. Runtime $O(n)$
* [Partition](partition.py)
	* Partition a linked list around a value x such that all nodes with values less than x come before all nodes with values greater than or equal to x.
	* Runtime $O(n)$
* [Remove Duplicates](removeDups.py)
	* Remove duplicates from a singly linked list. 
	* Runtime $O(n)$
* [Reverse](reverseLinkedlst.py)
	* Reverse a singly linked list iteratively or recursively.
	* Runtime $O(n)$
